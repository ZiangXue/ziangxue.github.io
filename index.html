<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>

<p>The project will mainly focus on training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of classifying images of different types of clouds. The desired data set will be photos of clouds taken from ground-based camera, e.g. your smart phone.</p>

<p>The trained CNN will be deployed on a (possibly web based) application on which users can upload their pictures and get a classification of the cloud contained the picture. Then probably it will also give a prompt for the answer (in which case the user might actually know the correct answer). This information makes the photo useful for training (since it will then get labeled.</p>

<p>Future development of the application can be associating the pictures with location information. We can look up what different cloud type reveals about the change of weather. This would help to make local weather forecast (especially rain forecast) more accurate.</p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Create a dataset of the aforementioned photos of cloud to train the CNN with.</li>
  <li>Find ways to isolate noise from cloud with pre-processing</li>
  <li>Train the CNN to categorize picture between 3 main types of clouds</li>
  <li>Build an application centered by the trained CNN.</li>
  <li>Perhaps, find a way to combine this forecast with location data and compare to local rain forecast.</li>
</ol>
