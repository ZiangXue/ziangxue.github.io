<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>

<p>The project will mainly focus on training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of classifying images containing copies of handwriting (with English characters). The goal of the CNN is to be able to tell if a certain handwriting script is from a certain person. The idea is eventually the user can feed the CNN a sample of someone's handwriting (so, labeled) and then a sample for testing (not labeled), and have the CNN to tell if the testing samples are written by the labeled author.</p>

<p> Some concern: It is questionable whether a traditional CNN can do this. If we are feeding the CNN both labeled data and non-labeled data, how should we train the CNN with?</p>

<p>The trained CNN will be deployed on a (possibly web based) application on which users can upload images of labeled and non-labeled handwriting. The application will then process the image, feed the data to the CNN and get a result.</p>

<p>Another possible tweak of this project is to have the application generate (instead of validate) handwriting that are similar to that of a certain peoson's handwriting..</p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Think of ways to address the aforementioned concerns.</li>
  <li>Create a dataset of handwriting scripts to train the CNN with.</li>
  <li>Find ways to pre-process image to make training easier for the CNN.</li>
  <li>Train the CNN to (possibly) tell if two handwriting are the same.</li>
  <li>Build an application centered by the trained CNN.</li>
</ol>
